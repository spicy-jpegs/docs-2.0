# Creating a Wallet

To use Stargaze, you'll need a Cosmos-compatible wallet. We recommend Keplr or Leap.

4. Create a new wallet or import an existing one

## Security Tips

* **Never share your seed phrase** - No legitimate service will ever ask for it

* **Use a hardware wallet** for large holdings (Ledger supported)
* **Verify URLs** - Always check you're on the official site
