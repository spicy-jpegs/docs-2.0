# Paying with Different Tokens\*\*

Stargaze supports multi-token payments, so you're not locked into a single currency.

## Supported Tokens

| Token     | Description                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| **ATOM**  | Cosmos Hub native token (primary) |
| **TIA**   | Celestia token                    |
| **BTC**   | Bitcoin (via IBC)                 |
| **STARS** | Stargaze STARS                    |
| **USDC**  | USD stablecoin                    |

_More tokens may be added over time._

## How It Works

When you buy an NFT:

1. View the listing price (displayed in the seller's preferred token)
2. Choose which token you want to pay with
3. The swap happens automatically at current market rates
4. Complete the purchase in one transaction

## Swapping Tokens

Need to swap between tokens? Use the built-in swap feature powered by Skip:

1. Click the swap icon in the navigation
2. Select your input token and amount
3. Select your output token
4. Review the rate and confirm

## Tips

* **Check rates** - Swap rates fluctuate with market prices
* **ATOM for gas** - You'll always need a small amount of ATOM for transaction fees
* **Slippage** - Large swaps may have some slippage; check the quoted amount

## Coming from Other Chains?

You can bridge tokens from other ecosystems using IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication). Popular routes:

* **From Osmosis** - Direct IBC transfer
* **From Celestia** - TIA via IBC
* **From Noble** - USDC via IBC
