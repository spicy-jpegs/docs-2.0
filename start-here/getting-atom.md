# Getting ATOM

ATOM is the primary currency on Stargaze. You'll need it to buy NFTs, pay for gas fees, and interact with the marketplace.

## Where to Buy ATOM

### Centralized Exchanges

The easiest way to get ATOM if you're new to crypto:

* **Coinbase** - [coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com)
* **Kraken** - [kraken.com](https://www.kraken.com)
* **Binance** - [binance.com](https://www.binance.com)
* **Crypto.com** - [crypto.com](https://www.crypto.com)

**Steps:**
1. Create an account and complete verification
2. Deposit funds (bank transfer, card, etc.)
3. Buy ATOM
4. Withdraw to your Keplr/Leap wallet address

### Decentralized Exchanges

If you already have crypto in Cosmos:

* **Osmosis** - [osmosis.zone](https://osmosis.zone) - Swap other Cosmos tokens for ATOM
* **Skip** - Integrated swap within Stargaze

## Withdrawing to Your Wallet

When withdrawing from an exchange:

1. Go to Withdraw/Send
2. Select ATOM
3. Choose **Cosmos Hub** network (not other chains)
4. Paste your wallet address (starts with `cosmos1...`)
5. Confirm the transaction

Transfers typically take 1-2 minutes.

## How Much Do I Need?

* **Gas fees** - Usually less than $0.01 per transaction
* **Buying NFTs** - Depends on the collection (check floor prices)
* **Recommended start** - 5-10 ATOM to explore comfortably

## Using Other Tokens

Stargaze supports multiple tokens for payments including TIA, BTC, and USDC. See [Paying with Different Tokens](paying-with-different-tokens.md) for details.
