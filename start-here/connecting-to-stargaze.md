# Connecting to Stargaze

Once you have a wallet set up, connecting to Stargaze takes just a few clicks.

## Connect Your Wallet

1. Go to [stargaze.zone](https://stargaze.zone)
2. Click **Connect Wallet** in the top right corner
3. Select your wallet provider (Keplr, Leap, etc.)
4. Approve the connection in your wallet popup

That's it! You're connected.

## What Happens When You Connect

When you connect your wallet, Stargaze can:
* View your public address
* See your NFT holdings
* Request transaction signatures (you approve each one)

Stargaze **cannot**:
* Access your private keys
* Move funds without your approval
* See your seed phrase

## Multiple Wallets

You can connect multiple wallets to your Stargaze account:
1. Click your profile icon
2. Go to Settings
3. Link additional wallets

This lets you view and manage NFTs across all your addresses in one place.

## Disconnecting

To disconnect:
1. Click your profile icon
2. Click **Disconnect**

Your NFTs stay safe in your wallet - disconnecting just ends the browser session.

## Troubleshooting

**Wallet not connecting?**
* Make sure the browser extension is installed and unlocked
* Try refreshing the page
* Check if you have pending approval popups

**Wrong network?**
* Ensure your wallet is set to Cosmos Hub
* Stargaze will prompt you to switch if needed

**Still having issues?**
* See [Troubleshooting](../help/troubleshooting.md) for more help
