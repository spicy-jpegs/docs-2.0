# Pricing

Understanding how Stargaze Names are priced.

## Registration Pricing

Name prices are based on **character length**:

| Characters | Price/Year (ATOM) |
|------------|-------------------|
| 3 | ~100 ATOM |
| 4 | ~25 ATOM |
| 5+ | ~5 ATOM |

*Prices are approximate and may vary. Check current rates during registration.*

## Why Length Matters

Shorter names are:
* More memorable
* Higher demand
* Limited supply (only 36³ = 46,656 possible 3-char names)

Longer names are:
* More available
* Affordable for everyone
* Still fully functional

## Renewal Pricing

Renewals cost the same as registration:
* Same price per year
* Based on current rates
* No penalty for late renewal (within grace period)

## Payment

Names are paid for in **ATOM**.

The price shown includes:
* Registration/renewal fee
* Gas fee (~negligible)

## Secondary Market Pricing

On the marketplace, prices are set by:
* **Sellers** - List at any price they choose
* **Market** - Supply and demand

Valuable name characteristics:
* Short (3-4 characters)
* Dictionary words
* Brandable terms
* Numbers (000-999)
* No hyphens or odd characters

## Price Examples

| Name | Why Valuable |
|------|--------------|
| sun.stars | 3 letters, common word |
| cosmos.stars | Brand/ecosystem relevant |
| 007.stars | Iconic number |
| defi.stars | Industry term |

| Name | Why Affordable |
|------|----------------|
| myname123.stars | Long, includes numbers |
| john-smith.stars | Long, includes hyphen |
| abcdefgh.stars | Long, not a word |

## Tips

* **Budget accordingly** - Short names cost more
* **Consider ROI** - Will you use it or resell?
* **Watch the market** - Prices fluctuate
* **Register longer** - Multi-year saves per-year cost
