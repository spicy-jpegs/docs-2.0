# Renewals

Stargaze Names require periodic renewal to maintain ownership.

## Why Renewals?

Renewals serve important purposes:
* Keeps the namespace active
* Prevents indefinite squatting
* Gives others a chance at abandoned names
* Encourages engaged ownership

## Renewal Period

Names are registered for:
* **Minimum:** 1 year
* **Maximum:** 5 years

You can renew at any time to extend your registration.

## How to Renew

### Before Expiration

1. Go to your name's page (or your profile)
2. Click **Renew**
3. Select additional years (1-5)
4. Pay the renewal fee
5. Confirm the transaction

Your expiration date extends by the selected duration.

### Grace Period

If your name expires:
* **30-day grace period** - Only you can renew
* Same renewal price
* Name still resolves to your address
* Cannot be registered by others yet

### After Grace Period

If not renewed within 30 days:
* Name becomes available
* Anyone can register it
* Original owner has no priority

## Renewal Costs

Renewal pricing matches registration:

| Length | Cost/Year |
|--------|-----------|
| 3 characters | Higher |
| 4 characters | Medium |
| 5+ characters | Base price |

No penalty for late renewal (within grace period).

## Checking Expiration

View your name's status:
1. Go to your profile
2. Click on your name
3. See **Expires:** date

Or search for any name to see its expiration.

## Notifications

Don't miss your renewal:
* Set up email notifications
* Enable Telegram alerts
* Check your names periodically

We'll remind you before expiration.

## Tips

* **Renew early** - Don't risk losing your name
* **Renew for longer** - Lock in your name for years
* **Set reminders** - Mark your calendar

## What Happens to Expired Names?

1. **Day 1-30:** Grace period (only you can renew)
2. **Day 31+:** Available for public registration
3. Someone else registers → They own it now

Don't let valuable names lapse!
