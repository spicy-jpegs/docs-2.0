# What is a Stargaze Name?

Stargaze Names are human-readable identities for your Cosmos address.

## The Problem

Cosmos addresses look like this:

```
cosmos1abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu
```

Hard to remember, easy to make mistakes.

## The Solution

With a Stargaze Name, your address becomes:

```
starty.stars
```

Simple, memorable, yours.

## How It Works

When you register a Stargaze Name:

1. The name is minted as an NFT
2. It's linked to your wallet address
3. Others can send you funds using just your name
4. You can trade it like any other NFT
