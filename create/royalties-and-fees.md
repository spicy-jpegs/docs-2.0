# Royalties & Fees

Understanding the costs and earnings for creators on Stargaze.

## Creator Royalties

Royalties are your ongoing earnings from secondary sales.

### How They Work

When someone resells an NFT from your collection:
1. Sale happens on the marketplace
2. Your royalty is automatically calculated
3. Funds are sent to your royalty wallet
4. No action needed from you

### Setting Royalties

When creating your collection:
* **Minimum:** 0%
* **Maximum:** 10%
* **Recommended:** 5-7% for most projects

Once set, royalties cannot be changed.

### Royalty Wallet

Designate where royalties are sent:
* Can be a single wallet
* Can be a multisig
* Can be split between multiple addresses

Set this during collection creation.

## Launch Costs

### Contract Deployment

Creating your collection on-chain costs:
* ~5-20 ATOM depending on collection size
* Paid once during deployment

### IPFS Storage

Your images and metadata are stored on IPFS:
* Included in deployment cost
* Permanent storage
* No ongoing fees

### Gas Fees

Small fees for each transaction:
* ~0.01 ATOM per operation
* Paid when you interact with the contract

## Mint Revenue

### Primary Sales

When someone mints from your collection:
* You receive the mint price
* Minus gas fees (~negligible)
* Paid directly to your wallet

### Example

Collection: 1,000 NFTs at 10 ATOM each
* Gross revenue: 10,000 ATOM
* Your earnings: ~10,000 ATOM (minus small gas)

## Secondary Revenue

### From Royalties

Ongoing income from resales:
* 5% royalty on 100 ATOM sale = 5 ATOM to you

## Fee Summary

| When | Fee | Who Pays |
|------|-----|----------|
| Deployment | ~5-20 ATOM | Creator |
| Each mint | Gas (~0.01 ATOM) | Minter |

## Tips

* **Price mints fairly** - Consider gas costs for minters
* **Set reasonable royalties** - Too high discourages trading
* **Plan for taxes** - Keep records of your earnings
* **Use a dedicated wallet** - Easier tracking and security
