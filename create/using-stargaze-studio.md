## Getting Started

1. Go to [studio.stargaze.zone](https://studio.stargaze.zone)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Click **Create Collection**

## Creating a Collection

### Step 1: Collection Details

Fill in your collection information:

* **Name** - Your collection's name
* **Symbol** - Short identifier (e.g., "BADKIDS")
* **Description** - Tell people what your collection is about
* **Cover image** - Banner for your collection page

### Step 2: Upload Assets

Upload your NFT files:

1. Prepare a folder with all your images
2. Name files sequentially (1.png, 2.png, etc.)
3. Upload via drag-and-drop or file picker
4. Wait for IPFS pinning to complete

### Step 3: Metadata

Add traits and attributes:

* Upload a metadata JSON file, or
* Use the built-in trait editor
* Preview how your NFTs will appear

### Step 4: Minting Configuration

Set up how minting works:

**Supply:**

* Total number of NFTs

**Pricing:**

* Mint price per NFT
* Payment token (ATOM, etc.)

**Limits:**

* Per-wallet mint limit
* Per-transaction limit

### Step 5: Whitelist (Optional)

Create whitelist phases:

1. Click **Add Whitelist**
2. Upload addresses (CSV or paste)
3. Set whitelist price (often discounted)
4. Set start and end times
5. Add multiple phases if needed

### Step 6: Schedule

Set your launch timing:

* **Whitelist start** - When whitelisted users can mint
* **Public start** - When anyone can mint
* **End time** - When minting closes (optional)

### Step 7: Review & Deploy

1. Review all settings
2. Check the cost estimate
3. Click **Deploy Collection**
4. Approve the transaction in your wallet

Your collection contract will be created on-chain.

## After Deployment

### Starting the Mint

If you set a future start time, minting begins automatically. Otherwise:

1. Go to your collection in Studio
2. Click **Start Minting**

### Monitoring

Track your launch:

* Mints in real-time
* Revenue collected
* Remaining supply

### Making Changes

Some settings can be updated after deployment:

* Adding whitelist addresses
* Adjusting end times
* Updating collection metadata

Some cannot be changed:

* Total supply
* Contract address

## Tips for Success

* **Test first** - Use testnet to practice
* **Double-check metadata** - Errors are hard to fix post-mint
* **Prepare for traffic** - Popular mints can be busy
* **Communicate clearly** - Tell your community exactly when and how to mint
