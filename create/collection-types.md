## Choosing the Right Type

| If you want...             | Choose...           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Classic NFT drop with hype | Standard Collection |
| Low cost, simple launch    | Light Mint          |
| Maximum participation      | Open Edition        |
| High-value art sales       | 1/1 Art             |

## Technical Differences

All collection types use the CW721 standard on Cosmos Hub, ensuring:

* Full Marketplace compatibility
* Royalty enforcement (creator needs to stay active)
* IBC transferability

The differences are mainly in minting mechanics and pricing, not the underlying NFT standard.
