# Fees

Understanding the costs of buying and selling on Stargaze.

## Marketplace Fees

When an NFT sells on Stargaze:

| Fee Type            | Amount              | Paid By        |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| **Marketplace fee** | 3%                  | Seller         |
| **Creator royalty** | x% (set by creator) | Seller         |
| **Gas fee**         | varies              | Buyer & Seller |

### Example

If an NFT sells for 100 ATOM with 5% royalties:

* Seller receives: 92 ATOM (100 - 3% marketplace - 5% royalty)
* Creator receives: 5 ATOM
* Marketplace receives: 3 ATOM

## Minting Fees

When minting from a new collection:

* **Mint price** - Set by the creator
* **Gas fee** - per mint

## Gas Fees

Gas fees are paid to the Cosmos Hub for processing transactions. On Stargaze, these are typically very low (fractions of a cent).

You pay gas when you:

* Buy or sell an NFT
* Make or cancel an offer
* List or delist an NFT
* Transfer an NFT
* Mint an NFT

## Creator Royalties

Royalties are optional fees set by collection creators. They're paid automatically on every secondary sale, giving creators ongoing income from their work.

* Minimum: 0%
* Paid on every resale
* Creators need to stay active: inactive creator wallets (1+ year) will not receive royalties anymore. The collection royalties will be reduced to 0% in this case.
