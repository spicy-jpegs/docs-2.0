# Fees

Understanding the costs of buying and selling on Stargaze.

## Marketplace Fees

When an NFT sells on Stargaze:

| Fee Type | Amount | Paid By |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Marketplace fee** | 2% | Seller |
| **Creator royalty** | 0-10% (set by creator) | Seller |
| **Gas fee** | ~$0.01 | Buyer & Seller |

### Example

If an NFT sells for 100 ATOM with 5% royalties:
* Seller receives: 93 ATOM (100 - 2% marketplace - 5% royalty)
* Creator receives: 5 ATOM
* Marketplace receives: 2 ATOM

## Minting Fees

When minting from a new collection:
* **Mint price** - Set by the creator
* **Gas fee** - ~$0.01 per mint

## Gas Fees

Gas fees are paid to the Cosmos Hub for processing transactions. On Stargaze, these are typically very low (fractions of a cent).

You pay gas when you:
* Buy or sell an NFT
* Make or cancel an offer
* List or delist an NFT
* Transfer an NFT
* Mint an NFT

## Creator Royalties

Royalties are optional fees set by collection creators. They're paid automatically on every secondary sale, giving creators ongoing income from their work.

* Minimum: 0%
* Maximum: 10%
* Paid on every resale

## No Hidden Fees

Stargaze doesn't charge:
* Account creation fees
* Listing fees
* Offer fees
* Withdrawal fees

What you see is what you pay.
