# Claiming Your STARS

How to claim your STARS tokens on the Cosmos Hub.

## Overview

STARS tokens are migrating to the Cosmos Hub. If you held STARS on Stargaze L1, you can claim them on the Hub.

## Eligibility

You can claim if you held STARS:
* In your wallet on Stargaze L1
* Staked with validators
* In liquidity pools (Osmosis)

## How to Claim

### Step 1: Connect Wallet

1. Go to [stargaze.zone](https://stargaze.zone)
2. Connect the wallet that held your STARS
3. The system checks your eligibility

### Step 2: View Your Allocation

You'll see:
* Total STARS to claim
* Breakdown by source (wallet, staking, LP)
* Claim button

### Step 3: Claim

1. Click **Claim STARS**
2. Approve the transaction
3. STARS arrive in your Hub wallet

## Claim Details

* **Cost:** Free (only gas fees ~0.01 ATOM)
* **Expiration:** Claims do not expire
* **Vesting:** None - tokens are immediately available

## What About Staked STARS?

If your STARS were staked:
* Automatically included in snapshot
* No need to unstake first
* Claim the full amount

## What About LP Tokens?

STARS in Osmosis liquidity pools:
* Snapshot includes your LP position
* Claim your STARS portion
* LP tokens on Osmosis remain separate

## After Claiming

Your STARS on the Hub can be used for:
* Minting NFTs
* Trading NFTs
* Trading on DEXs

### Community Pool Restructure

The STARS community pool will be restructured through an on-chain proposal. Funds will be distributed to community DAOs who will manage ongoing initiatives, grants, and ecosystem development.

Details will be announced via a Commonwealth vote before migration.

Note: STARS no longer has staking or governance utility since Stargaze is no longer a standalone chain.

## Troubleshooting

### "No STARS to claim"

* Verify correct wallet
* Check if STARS were on a different address
* Ensure you held STARS before the snapshot

### "Amount seems wrong"

* Snapshot was at a specific block
* Transfers after snapshot not included
* Contact support with details

## Liquidity on Osmosis

A stable swap pool exists on Osmosis:
* Swap between old and new STARS
* Exit to stablecoins if desired
* Normal DEX functionality
