# What's Happening

Stargaze is migrating from its own blockchain to the Cosmos Hub.

## The Big Picture

In early 2026, Stargaze is moving:
* **From:** Stargaze L1 (independent chain)
* **To:** Cosmos Hub (as an application)

This means all NFTs, Names, and the STARS token are moving to a new home.

## Why Migrate?

### Stronger Together

The Cosmos Hub is the center of the Cosmos ecosystem:
* More liquidity (ATOM)
* More users
* Stronger security
* Better aligned with the ecosystem's future

### Better for Users

* **Multi-token payments** - Pay with ATOM, TIA, BTC, USDC
* **Lower friction** - No need for a separate STARS balance for gas
* **More activity** - Larger user base

### Sustainable Development

* Funded development through Cosmos Hub community
* Dedicated team continuing to build
* Long-term commitment to the platform

## What's Moving

| Moving to Hub | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| All NFT collections | Claimable |
| Stargaze Names | Claimable |
| STARS token | Claimable |
| Marketplace | Live on Hub |
| Launchpad | Live on Hub |
| Studio | Live on Hub |

## What's Not Moving

| Discontinued | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| Stargaze L1 chain | Shutting down |
| Validators/staking | No longer a chain |
| Infinity Swap | Discontinued |
| StarDEX | Discontinued |

## Timeline

1. **Preparation** - Contracts paused on L1, snapshots taken
2. **Hub Deployment** - Apps go live on Cosmos Hub
3. **Claims Open** - Users claim their NFTs and STARS
4. **L1 Sunset** - Original chain winds down
