# Claiming Your NFTs

How to claim your NFTs on the Cosmos Hub after migration.

## Airdrops vs Claims

### Top 100 Collections
The top 100 collections by 2025 trading volume will be automatically airdropped to your wallet. No action required, no cost.

### Other Collections
Collections outside the top 100 must be claimed manually. Gas fees apply.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
* The wallet that held your NFTs on Stargaze L1
* A small amount of ATOM for gas fees (~0.1 ATOM)
* Access to [stargaze.zone](https://stargaze.zone)

## How Claims Work

Your NFTs were snapshotted before migration. To claim:
1. Connect your original wallet
2. View your claimable NFTs
3. Claim them to your Hub address
4. They appear in your collection

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Connect Wallet

1. Go to [stargaze.zone](https://stargaze.zone)
2. Click **Connect Wallet**
3. Use the same wallet that held your L1 NFTs

### Step 2: View Claimable NFTs

1. Go to your **Profile**
2. Click the **Claims** tab
3. See all NFTs available to claim

### Step 3: Claim Your NFTs

1. Select the collections you want to claim
2. Click **Claim**
3. Approve the transaction
4. Wait for processing to complete

**You only need to claim once.** The system handles batching automatically behind the scenes due to block space limits. This may take several minutes depending on how many NFTs you hold.

### Step 4: Verify

After claiming:
* NFTs appear in your **Collected** tab
* They're tradeable on the marketplace
* Full functionality restored

## Costs

**Top 100 collections:** Free (airdropped automatically)

**Other collections:**
* **Claim fee:** Free
* **Gas fee:** Paid in ATOM (exact amount TBD)

## Timing

* **Claims open:** When Hub deployment is live
* **Claims expire:** Never - claim anytime
* **Processing time:** May take several minutes for large collections (batching handled automatically)

## Troubleshooting

### "No NFTs to claim"

* Verify you're using the correct wallet
* Check if NFTs were in a DAO (see [special cases](nfts-on-other-chains.md))
* NFTs may have been on a different address

### "Transaction failed"

* Ensure you have enough ATOM for gas
* Try claiming fewer NFTs at once
* Wait and retry if network is busy

### "Wrong NFTs showing"

* The snapshot was taken at a specific block
* NFTs transferred after snapshot belong to the new owner
* Contact support if you believe there's an error

## After Claiming

Your NFTs are now on the Cosmos Hub:
* List them for sale
* Make offers on others
* Transfer to friends
* Full marketplace functionality
