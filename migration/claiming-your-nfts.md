# Claiming Your NFTs

How to claim your NFTs on the Cosmos Hub after migration.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
* The wallet that held your NFTs on Stargaze L1
* A small amount of ATOM for gas fees (~0.1 ATOM)
* Access to [stargaze.zone](https://stargaze.zone)

## How Claims Work

Your NFTs were snapshotted before migration. To claim:
1. Connect your original wallet
2. View your claimable NFTs
3. Claim them to your Hub address
4. They appear in your collection

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Connect Wallet

1. Go to [stargaze.zone](https://stargaze.zone)
2. Click **Connect Wallet**
3. Use the same wallet that held your L1 NFTs

### Step 2: View Claimable NFTs

1. Go to your **Profile**
2. Click the **Claims** tab
3. See all NFTs available to claim

### Step 3: Claim Your NFTs

**Option A: Claim All**
1. Click **Claim All**
2. Approve the transaction
3. All NFTs mint to your wallet

**Option B: Claim Individually**
1. Select specific NFTs
2. Click **Claim Selected**
3. Approve the transaction

### Step 4: Verify

After claiming:
* NFTs appear in your **Collected** tab
* They're tradeable on the marketplace
* Full functionality restored

## Costs

* **Claim fee:** Free
* **Gas fee:** ~0.01 ATOM per NFT (paid in ATOM)

For large collections, you may want to claim in batches.

## Timing

* **Claims open:** When Hub deployment is live
* **Claims expire:** Never - claim anytime
* **Processing time:** Instant (one transaction)

## Troubleshooting

### "No NFTs to claim"

* Verify you're using the correct wallet
* Check if NFTs were in a DAO (see [special cases](nfts-on-other-chains.md))
* NFTs may have been on a different address

### "Transaction failed"

* Ensure you have enough ATOM for gas
* Try claiming fewer NFTs at once
* Wait and retry if network is busy

### "Wrong NFTs showing"

* The snapshot was taken at a specific block
* NFTs transferred after snapshot belong to the new owner
* Contact support if you believe there's an error

## After Claiming

Your NFTs are now on the Cosmos Hub:
* List them for sale
* Make offers on others
* Transfer to friends
* Full marketplace functionality
