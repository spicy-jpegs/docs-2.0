# Migration FAQ

Common questions about the Stargaze migration to Cosmos Hub.

For general Stargaze questions, see the [FAQ](../help/faq.md).

## General

### When is the snapshot?

February 2026. Exact date and block will be announced via Twitter and Discord.

### Why is Stargaze migrating?

To strengthen the Cosmos ecosystem by consolidating on the Hub, providing better liquidity through ATOM, and ensuring sustainable development.

### When did the migration happen?

The migration launched in Q1 2026. Check announcements for exact dates.

### Do I need to do anything?

Yes - you need to claim your NFTs and STARS tokens. They don't transfer automatically.

### Is there a deadline to claim?

No. Claims do not expire. Take your time.

## NFTs

### Which collections are airdropped automatically?

The top 100 collections by 2025 trading volume will be airdropped automatically - no action needed, no cost. All other collections must be claimed manually.

### Will my NFTs look the same?

Yes. Metadata and images are preserved exactly.

### Can I trade during migration?

Trading on L1 stopped at snapshot. Trading on Hub begins when claims open.

### What happens to NFTs listed for sale at snapshot?

The seller keeps them. Listings are not transferred - you'll need to relist on the Hub.

### What happens to pending offers at snapshot?

Offers are removed. Funds are returned to the person who made the offer.

### What about traits and rarity?

All trait data is preserved. Rarity rankings remain the same.

### Are royalties preserved?

Yes. Creator royalties transfer to the Hub contracts.

## STARS Token

### What happens to my STARS?

Claim them on the Cosmos Hub. They're still STARS, just on a new chain.

### Can I still stake STARS?

No. Stargaze is no longer a blockchain, so there's no staking.

### What's STARS used for now?

STARS can be used for minting NFTs, trading NFTs, and trading on DEXs.

### What about STARS on Osmosis?

Liquidity pools continue to function. A stable swap pool helps transition.

## Technical

### Do I need a new wallet?

No. Your existing Cosmos wallet works. Same seed phrase, same keys.

### What's my new address?

Your `stars1...` address converts to `cosmos1...` with the same underlying keys.

### Is it safe?

Yes. Standard Cosmos Hub security. Your keys never leave your wallet.

### What about gas fees?

Gas is paid in ATOM on the Hub. Fees are very low (~$0.01).

## Special Situations

### My NFTs were in a DAO

DAOs couldn't migrate automatically. Check with your DAO leadership about distribution.

### My NFTs were on another chain

ICS-721 NFTs return to their home chains. Check collection announcements.

### I had stSTARS

Unwind your liquid staking position first, then claim STARS.

### I lost my wallet

Unfortunately, claims require the original wallet. Standard crypto rules apply.

---

## Old Chain

### Can I still use Stargaze L1?

No. The chain is being sunset. All activity moves to Hub.

### What happens to validators?

Validators are no longer needed. The Hub has its own validator set.

### Are old links broken?

Old stargaze.zone links redirect to the Hub version.
