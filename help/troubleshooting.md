**Try these steps:**

1. Refresh the page
2. Make sure wallet extension is installed and unlocked
3. Check for pending popups (may be behind other windows)
4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting
5. Clear browser cache and try again

**Still not working?**

* Update your wallet extension
* Try a different browser
* Disable other wallet extensions temporarily

### Wrong network

If prompted to switch networks:

1. Click "Switch Network" in the popup
2. Or manually switch to Cosmos Hub in your wallet settings

### Transaction stuck/pending

Transactions are usually instant. If stuck:

1. Wait a few minutes
2. Check transaction status in your wallet
3. Refresh the page
4. The transaction may have failed silently - check your balances

## Transaction Errors

### "Insufficient funds"

You need ATOM for gas fees. Solutions:

* Get at least 0.1 ATOM in your wallet
* Gas fees are small but required for every transaction

### "Transaction failed"

Common causes:

* Network congestion - wait and retry
* Insufficient gas - shouldn't happen with default settings
* Item already sold - someone else bought it first

### "Rejected by user"

You clicked "Reject" in your wallet. Simply retry and click "Approve" this time.

### "Out of gas"

Rare on Cosmos. If it happens:

* Try the transaction again
* Contact support if it persists
